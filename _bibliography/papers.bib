    abstract = {Depth estimation from images has long been regarded as a preferable alternative compared to expensive and intrusive active sensors, such as LiDAR and ToF.
                The topic has attracted the attention of an increasingly wide audience thanks to the great amount of application domains, such as autonomous driving, robotic navigation and 3D reconstruction. 

                Among the various techniques employed for depth estimation, stereo matching is one of the most widespread, owing to its robustness, speed and simplicity in setup.
                Recent developments has been aided by the abundance of annotated stereo images, which granted to deep learning the opportunity to thrive in a research area where deep networks can reach state-of-the-art sub-pixel precision in most cases.

                Despite the recent findings, stereo matching still begets many open challenges, two among them being finding pixel correspondences in presence of objects that exhibits a non-Lambertian behaviour and processing high-resolution images.

                Recently, a novel dataset named Booster, which contains high-resolution stereo pairs featuring a large collection of labeled non-Lambertian objects, has been released.
                The work shown that training state-of-the-art deep neural network on such data improves the generalization capabilities of these networks also in presence of non-Lambertian surfaces.
                Regardless being a further step to tackle the aforementioned challenge, Booster includes a rather small number of annotated images, and thus cannot satisfy the intensive training requirements of deep learning.

                This thesis work aims to investigate novel view synthesis techniques to augment the Booster dataset, with ultimate goal of improving stereo matching reliability in presence of high-resolution images that displays non-Lambertian surfaces.},

    abstract = {Estimating depth from images nowadays yields outstanding results, both in terms of in-domain accuracy and generalization. However, we identify two main challenges that remain open in this field: dealing with non-Lambertian materials and effectively processing high-resolution images. Purposely, we propose a novel dataset that includes accurate and dense ground-truth labels at high resolution, featuring scenes containing several specular and transparent surfaces. Our acquisition pipeline leverages a novel deep space-time stereo framework, enabling easy and accurate labeling with sub-pixel precision. The dataset is composed of 606 samples collected in 85 different scenes, each sample includes both a high-resolution pair (12 Mpx) as well as an unbalanced stereo pair (Left: 12 Mpx, Right: 1.1 Mpx), typical of modern mobile devices that mount sensors with different resolutions. Additionally, we provide manually annotated material segmentation masks and 15 K unlabeled samples. The dataset is composed of a train set and two test sets, the latter devoted to the evaluation of stereo and monocular depth estimation networks. Our experiments highlight the open challenges and future research directions in this field.},
