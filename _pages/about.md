I got a BSc degree in Automation Engineering in 2020 - from the University of Bologna - with a thesis work on predictive maintenance of bearing rings via acceleration signals analysis with Bayesian classifiers.

Then, I got an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence in 2022 - from the University of Bologna - with a <a href='https://amslaurea.unibo.it/26933/'>thesis work</a> on the mitigation of non-Lambertian surfaces issues that arise in Stereo Matching, by employing Neural Radiance Fields.

At the moment, I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Vision at University of Bologna.
